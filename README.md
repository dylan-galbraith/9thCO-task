# FizzBuzz

This page starts out just by displaying a button. Once the button is clicked, it triggers a function that starts placing the numbers 1-100 in an unordered list. As it adds each number, it first checks if its a multiple of 3. If so, it will append the word Fizz. Then it checks if it is a multiple of 5. If so, it appends the word Buzz. If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it will display FizzBuzz after the number.
